# edge_pydb
Python-based database for CARMA EDGE.  This package requires Python 3.

The EDGE database has several components (see `index_csv.md` and `index_hdf.txt` for details):

* Zero-dimensional CSV tables (one value per galaxy), found in `dat_glob`.

* One-dimensional CSV tables (e.g. radial profiles or spectra), found in `dat_prof` and `dat_spec`.

* Downsampled 2D or 3D images, saved as HDF5 binary tables in the `img_` directories.

## Installation

Install the package directly from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/edge-pydb/) using

    pip install --user edge_pydb

or, if you prefer to keep the latest source code handy, by cloning this Github repository and running

    pip install --user .

in the directory containing `setup.py`.

The `--user` flag ensures the package is not installed in your system-wide Python directories, which you probably don't have write access to.  The package tries to save and update a configuration file `_config.json`, which provides the paths to all the database tables, so installation in your user area is recommended.  Alternatively, you may save the configuration file in a different location using (e.g.):

    import edge_pydb.util as edgeutil
    edgeutil.save_config('/path/to/config.json')

You will then need to load this file whenever you start the package:

    edgeutil.load_config('/path/to/config.json')

To uninstall you may use

    pip uninstall edge_pydb

but note that the `_config.json` will not be removed, so to fully uninstall you will need to delete the `edge_pydb` directory manually using (e.g.):

    rm -r ~/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/edge_pydb/

## Merging in large data sets

The Github package only contains data for a single galaxy (NGC 4047), for demonstration and testing purposes.  Larger data files can be downloaded as ZIP archives from Box.  It is recommended that you unpack additional files into a single directory that is easily accessible on your file system, and not inside your Python libraries (`site-packages` area).  Here is the suggested way to incorporate these into your runtime environment:

Leave the git directory in which this README is located.  (This ensures that the package runs from your `site-packages` area and not the current directory.)  Open an iPython shell and type:

    import edge_pydb.util as edgeutil
    edgeutil.listfiles(values=True)

This should show only the Github data installed in `site-packages`.  Now suppose the additional data files are in a folder called `pybase`.  Then

    edgeutil.add_from_dir('/path/to/pybase/', max_depth=0, copy=False)

will add the additional files to your environment.  This only needs to be done once after package installation, unless you add new files to `pybase`.  Here the `max_depth=0` parameter prevents files in subdirectories from being added.  Use the `listfiles` command above to verify that the expected tables are available.

## Basic Usage

    from edge_pydb import EdgeTable
    EdgeTable('list')

makes a listing of the available files.

    ctrpos = EdgeTable('edge_coflux_smo7.csv')

loads a CSV file.  `ctrpos` can now be treated like an astropy table, for example `ctrpos.info()` will summarize the contents and `ctrpos.pprint()` will print some of the data.

    ctrpos = EdgeTable('edge_coflux_smo7.csv', cols=['Name', 'coRactr_smo7', 'coDectr_smo7'])

loads the three specified columns only from the CSV file.

    leda  = EdgeTable('edge_leda.csv', cols=['Name', 'ledaD25', 'ledaPA', 'ledaIncl'])
    ctrpos.join(leda)

will merge a sub-table from `edge_leda.csv` into `ctrpos`.  We must select the `Name` column from both tables for the join to work.

    comom = EdgeTable('NGC4047.2d_smo7.hdf5', path='comom_smo')

loads an HDF5 file.  The path must be given, otherwise a listing of available paths is provided.

A `demo_notebk` folder provides examples of accessing and plotting database values in a Jupyter notebook.

## HDF5 File Contents

Detailed listings of the HDF5 files are provided in [index_hdf.txt](https://github.com/tonywong94/edge_pydb/blob/master/index_hdf.txt) at the top level.  Note that each HDF5 file can bundle several tables or "paths," and only one path can be read into `EdgeTable` at a time.

- **[label].pipe3d.hdf5**: These are CALIFA data products from Pipe3D.  As described in [Sanchez et al. (2016a)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016RMxAA..52..171S), there are five collections of images, bundled as `ELINES`, `SFH`, `SSP`, `flux_elines`, and `indices`.  These are also the names of the five paths in the HDF5 file.  Pixels are sampled from the original astrometric grid of CALIFA DR3, so these tables should **not** be joined with tables in the other HDF5 files.  Additional columns in the `ELINES` and `flux_elines` tables provide calculated star formation rates, H&alpha; extinctions, metallicities, and BPT classifications.

- **[label].2d_smo7.hdf5**: These contain the CARMA CO moment maps and the *matched resolution* CALIFA data, and are thus likely to be the key files for your analysis.  All are at a resolution of 7 arcsec (FWHM Gaussian beam), with astrometric grid defined by the CARMA images.  CO moment maps were generated using three different methods (`str`, `dil`, `smo`), with each method being a separate table (path) within the HDF5 file.  The straight (`str`) moment maps are generated without masking and have very poor signal-to-noise.  To reject noise, the dilated (`dil`) moment maps use a dilated mask that starts at a high significance contour (3.5&sigma; or greater in two consecutive channels) and expands to a surrounding 2&sigma; contour.  The smoothed (`smo`) moment maps use a mask that is obtained by smoothing the cube spatially (to 14") before constructing a dilated mask.  For most purposes the dilated masks produce the best results.  For the CALIFA data, which are found in separate tables named `ELINES_sm` etc., a separate run of Pipe3D has been performed on the smoothed CALIFA data, after matching to the 7" CARMA resolution.

- **[label].cocube_smo7.hdf5**: These contain the CARMA CO data cubes and mask cubes, at a resolution of 7 arcsec (FWHM Gaussian beam).  These tables have the same astrometric grid as those in **[label].2d_smo7.hdf5** and can be joined with those tables (but note values will be replicated along the velocity axis).

Available datasets will expand over time, but current values for [label] include `edge_carma` (which uses a square sampling grid spaced by 3", sufficient for Nyquist sampling the CARMA beam) and `edge_carma_allpix` (all pixel values saved, resulting in much longer tables).
