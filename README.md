# edge_pydb
Python-based database for CARMA EDGE.  This package requires Python 3.

The EDGE database has several components (see index_csv.md and index_hdf.txt for details):

* Zero-dimensional CSV tables (one value per galaxy), found in `dat_glob`.

* One-dimensional CSV tables (e.g. radial profiles or spectra), found in `dat_prof` and `dat_spec`.

* Downsampled 2D or 3D images, saved as HDF5 binary tables in the `img_` directories.

## Installation

Install the package directly from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/edge-pydb/) using

`pip install --user edge_pydb`

or, if you prefer to keep the latest source code handy, by cloning this Github repository and running

`pip install --user .`

in the directory containing `setup.py`.

The `--user` flag ensures the package is not installed in your system-wide Python directories, which you probably don't have write access to.  The package tries to save and update a configuration file `_config.json`, so installation in your user area is recommended.

If you have access to the protected archive (not on Github), you should also obtain the `team_files.py` script from Tony which will download and install the additional tables into the appropriate locations.  You can run this script in a shell or iPython environment (but should avoid doing so in the same directory as `setup.py`).  Currently the Github repository only includes HDF5 files for one galaxy, for demonstration and testing purposes.

A `demo_notebk` folder provides examples of accessing database values from a Jupyter notebook.

## Basic Usage

`from edge_pydb import EdgeTable`

`EdgeTable('list')`

- makes a listing of the available files

`ctrpos = EdgeTable('edge_coflux_smo7.csv')`

- loads a CSV file.  `ctrpos` can now be treated like an astropy table.

`ctrpos = EdgeTable('edge_coflux_smo7.csv', cols=['Name', 'coRactr_smo7', 'coDectr_smo7'])`

- loads the three specified columns only from the CSV file

`leda  = EdgeTable('edge_leda.csv', cols=['Name', 'ledaD25', 'ledaPA', 'ledaIncl'])`  
`ctrpos.join(leda)`

- will merge a sub-table from `edge_leda.csv` into `ctrpos`.  We must select the `Name` column for the join to work.

`comom = EdgeTable('NGC4047.comom_smo7.hdf5', path='smo')`

- loads an HDF5 file.  The path must be given, otherwise a listing of available paths is provided.

## Team Usage

For additional database files not in this Github repository, itâ€™s better to keep these in a separate, more visible directory in your file system, and not inside your Python libraries (site-packages area).  Here is the suggested way to do this:

- Leave the git directory in which this README is located.  Open an iPython shell and type:

`import edge_pydb.util as edgeutil`

`edgeutil.listfiles(values=True)`

- should show only the public data.  Now suppose the additional data files are in a folder called `pybase`.

`edgeutil.add_from_dir('/path/to/pybase/', copy=False)`

- will add these to your environment.  This only needs to be done once after package installation.
