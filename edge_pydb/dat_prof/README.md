Currently includes:
* CO Rotation curves from Leung et al. (2018 MNRAS 477, 254).
* CO and Ha rotation curves from Levy et al. (2018 ApJ 860, 92).  The 6 arcsec curves were used in the paper.
* Radial CO profiles from native CO resolution smoothed-mask moment maps (Wong et al. 2024).
* Rotation curves obtained with [3D Barolo](https://bbarolo.readthedocs.io), using dilated masks, for either fixed or fitted velocity dispersion.
