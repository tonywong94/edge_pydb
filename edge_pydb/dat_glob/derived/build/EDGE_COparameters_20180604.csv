Name: standard EDGE-CALIFA galaxy name
rfVsys: CO relativistic helocentric vsys (km/s); see VsysFlag for how this was derived 
rfVsysFlag: how is Vsys derived; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 3=LEDA
rfLSRK2helio: conversion from LSRK velocity to heliocentric velocity (km/s); V(helio)=V(LSRK)-LSRK2helio
rfRflat: the radius (arcsec) at which the rotation curve flattens from the Lelli+16 algorithm
rfVrotMaxL: the maximum CO rotation velocity (relativistic km/s) from the Lelli+2016 algorithm
rfeVrotMaxL: the error in rfVrotMaxL from the Lelli+2016 algorithm
rfVrotMaxLFlag: 0 = either rfeVrotMaxL\rfVrotMaxL > 10% rfeVrotMaxL>rfVrotMaxL rfeVrotMaxL=0 so rfRflat rfVrotMaxL and rfeVrotMaxL values are unreliable; 1 = rfRflat rfVrotMaxL and rfeVrotMaxL values are reliable
rfVrotMax: the maximum CO rotation velocity (relativistic km/s) using median Vrot at radii larger than 12 arcsec as used in Levy+18
rfeVrotMax: the error in rfVrotMax using standard deviation of Vrot at radii larger than 12 arcsec as used in Levy+18
rfPA: position angle (degrees) ranging from 0-365 degrees defined counterclockwise from North to approaching side of major axis; see PAFlag for how this was derived
rfPAFlag: this describes where the PA listed is from; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 2=outer optical isophotes; 3=LEDA
rfInc: inclination (degrees); see IncFlag for how this was derived
rfIncFlag: this describes where the inclination listed is from; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 2=outer optical isophotes; 3=LEDA
rfKinXoff: offset of CO kinematic center from ledaRA (arcsec); RA=ledaRA-xoff
rfKinYoff: offset of CO kinematic center from ledaDec (arcsec); Dec=ledaDE-yoff
rfKinRA: RA of kinematic center including rfKinXoff (J2000 hours); rfKinRA=ledaRA-rfKinXoff
rfKinDecl: Decl of kinematic center including rfKinYoff (J2000 degrees); rfKinDecl=ledaDE-rfKinYoff
