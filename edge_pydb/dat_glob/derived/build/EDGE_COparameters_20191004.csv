ledaDE: Decl from HyperLEDA Bolatto et al. 2017 (J2000 degrees),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfVsys: CO relativistic helocentric vsys (km/s); see VsysFlag for how this was derived,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfVsysFlag: how is Vsys derived; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 3=LEDA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfLSRK2helio: conversion from LSRK velocity to heliocentric velocity (km/s); V(helio)=V(LSRK)-LSRK2helio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfRflat: the radius (arcsec) at which the rotation curve flattens from the Lelli+16 algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rfeVrotMaxL: the error in rfVrotMaxL from the Lelli+2016 algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfVrotMaxLFlag: 0 = either rfeVrotMaxL\rfVrotMaxL > 10% rfeVrotMaxL>rfVrotMaxL rfeVrotmaxL=0 so rfRflat rfVrotMaxL and rfeVrotMaxL values are unreliable; 1 = rfRflat rfVrotMaxL and rfeVrotMaxL values are reliable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rfPA: position angle (degrees) ranging from 0-365 degrees defined counterclockwise from North to approaching side of major axis; see PAFlag for how this was derived,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfPAFlag: this describes where the PA listed is from; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 2=outer optical isophotes; 3=LEDA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfInc: inclination (degrees); see IncFlag for how this was derived,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rfIncFlag: this describes where the inclination listed is from; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 2=outer optical isophotes; 3=LEDA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
