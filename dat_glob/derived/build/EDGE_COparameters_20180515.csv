Name: standard EDGE-CALIFA galaxy name
rfVsys: CO relativistic helocentric vsys (km/s); see VsysFlag for how this was derived 
rfVsysFlag: how is Vsys derived; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 3=LEDA
rfRflat: the radius (arcsec) at which the rotation curve flattens from the Lelli+16 algorithm
rfVrotMax: the maximum CO rotation velocity (relativistic km/s) from the Lelli+2016 algorithm
rfeVrotMax: the error in rfVrotMax from the Lelli+2016 algorithm
rfVrotMaxFlag: 0 = either rfeVrotMax\rfVrotMax > 10% rfeVrotMax>rfVrotMax rfeVrotMax=0 so rfRflat rfVrotMax and rfeVrotMax values are unreliable; 1 = rfRflat rfVrotMax and rfeVrotMax value are reliable
rfPA: position angle (degrees) ranging from 0-365 degrees defined counterclockwise from North to approaching side of major axis; see PAFlag for how this was derived
rfPAFlag: this describes where the PA listed is from; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 2=outer optical isophotes; 3=LEDA
rfInc: inclination (degrees); see IncFlag for how this was derived
rfIncFlag: this describes where the inclination listed is from; 0=CO kinematics; 1=Ha kinematics; 2=outer optical isophotes; 3=LEDA
rfKinXoff: offset of CO kinematic center from RA (arcsec); RA=RA-xoff
rfKinYoff: offset of CO kinematic center from Dec (arcsec); Dec=Dec-yoff
